 * 
 * What is React Native
 * RN - open source framework for building native android and ios applications using react
 * JS to access platform-specific apis (such as camera and push notifications)
 * React components to define the appearance and behavior of your user interface
 * React itself a library designed for building user interfaces
 * react-dom for web apps and react-native for native mobile apps
 * 
 * Why React Native
 * IOS app require swift or objective-c
 * Android apps require Java or Kotlin
 * with approximately 31% on ios and 68% on android you would typically need to develop two separate apps using different technologies
 * with React Native you can create an app that works seamlessly on both platforms
 * 
 * High demand in job market

 * --------------------------
 * 
 * Expo VS React Native
 * React Native is an open-source framework maintained by META or facebook designed cross-platform apps
 * Expo is an open-source framework maintained by EXPO itself designed for building cross-platform apps
 * Unlike plain RN which can be challenging and time consuming to set up expo provides a streamlined experience
 * Expo has a suite of tools and services built around react native which greatly simplifies the development process
 * With Plain RN you cannot build IOS apps on a windows or linux machine Native IOS apps can only be built on a macOS machine
 * With Expo you can develop your app on windows or linux and run your app on a physical iphone
 * 
 * EXPO
 * Expo has evolved significantly over the years and now supports nearly all the features necessary for building mobile apps
 * In the event that you require access to native android or IOS code expo allows you to eject your app and work with a plain React Native CodeBase

 * 
 * Core Components
 * In Android and IOS development we employ a fundamental building block called a "View" for user interfaces
 * A view is a small rectangular element on the screen that can display text images or respond to user input
 * Android views are written in Kotlin or Java
 * IOS views are written in Swift or Objective-C
 * React Native - views using Javascript through React components
 * At run time React Native generates the corresponding Android and IOS views for these components
 * React Native offers a collection of essential pre built components knows as Core Components which is readily available for building your native app's user interface
 * 
 * Pressable -- wrapper component that detects various stages of press interactions on its defined children
 * Custom Button using Pressable
 * onPressIn is called when a press is activated
 * onLongPress is triggered when a press is held for longer than 500 ms
 * onPressOut is called when the press gesture is deactivated
 * 
 *  onPressIn - onPressOut and then onPress
 *            - after 500ms onLongPress then onPressOut
 * 
 * 
 * Activity Indicator
 * Displays a circular loading indicator
 * used to inform users about the status of ongoing processes such as loading an app submitting a form or saving updates

 * Styling RN Apps
 * RN does not use CSS for Styling
 * Style your app using Javascript
 * Names are written in camel case
